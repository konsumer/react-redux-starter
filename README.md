# react-redux-starter

This is a basic starter I made to help on codementor.  It includes a killer webpack setup for ES6 & react, and includes basic setup for react-router, redux, redux-form, etc. It uses react-bootstrap & animation.css, so you can focus on functionality and have it look ok.

## tooling

Install your dependencies with `npm install`.
Everyting uses `package.json` `script` entries.

* `npm start` - start a kickass development server that hot-reloads and has a sweet console dashboard.
* `npm test` - run unit-tests
* `npm run test:watch` - run unit-tests and watch for changes
* `npm run build` - make a static build of your app in webroot. You can deploy it anywhere!
* `npm run storybook` - run a [storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook), with lots of perks. (see [example](https://c301f665-3c09-47a4-8f2a-9f3dda99a6ce.sbook.io))
