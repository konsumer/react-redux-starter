# react-redux-starter

This is a basic strter I made to help on codementor.  It includes a killer webpack setup for ES6 & react, and includes basic setup for redux, redux-form, etc.

## tooling

Install your dependencies with `npm install`.
Everyting uses `package.json` `script` entries.

* `npm start` - start a kickass development server that hot-reloads and has a sweet console dashboard.
* `npm test` - run unit-tests
* `npm run test:watch` - run unit-tests and watch for changes
* `npm run build` - make a static build of your app in webroot. You can deploy it anywhere!
